# Movie-Recommender-System
With the increase in movies available on different streaming platforms , it is important to use a movie recommendation system that suggests movie watchers similar movies to make their movie watching experience better and seamless. So in this project Iâ€™m proposing a movie recommendation system that will be able to recommend movies to users based on movies they have already finished watching. It will collect all the relevant information from the database required for the best recommendation. It will give recommendations based on the information known about the users. The technique used by the system will be the Pearson Correlation technique.
